## Lazy nvim setup

I am using [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/spec) for my plugin manager. I am using
nvim-lspconfig as my lsp client.

## Important Commands

- `:checkhealth lazy` ensures that lazy.nvim is installed correctly.
- `:WhichKey` brings up documentation on the keys.
- `:LspInfo` provides information on LSP configuration.
- `<C-]>` in normal mode goes to definition and `<C-t>` takes you back to where you were.
- `K` in normal mode pulls up documentation on the symbol your cursor is on.
- `[d` in normal mode goes to previous diagnostic.
- `]d` in normal mode goes to next diagnostic.
